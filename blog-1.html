							<h1><a href="blog-1">Strategy product plan</a></h1>
							<p>For a product manager, creating a roadmap is not the same as creating a good strategic plan for products.

								In many technology companies, product managers are in charge of bringing the client's vision to the creation of the products.
								
								This means that their product planning is full of customer requests, technical incidents that customers have encountered or
								requests from the "internal customer" who needs this or that functionality in the product.</p>
								<p><h3>Who might ask us to include improvements in the product?</h3>

									- Customers <br>
									- Development Team to improve the technological architecture.<br>
									- Commercial department to increase sales.<br>
									- Support Department to solve the incidents found.<br>
									- The analysis of the competition that has been carried out</p>
									<p>With all this, the product roadmap becomes a list of tasks that are not closely related to each other and that are not aligned at all with the general strategy of the company.

										For this reason, product planning is not aligned with the strategic needs of the company, but rather is carried away by the day-to-day running of the company or by the particular needs of each department.
										
										And when we look at the planning for the next 3 months, we see that developments will be carried out that do not add significant value to the company.</p>
							<p><h3>The strategic vision for your product plan</h3>
								The product plan in technology companies that sell mainly digital products should be a strategic document.

								For this reason, the strategic product plan must be aligned with the multi-year strategy adopted by the company's Executive Committees.

In new products it is clear that the important thing is to be based on market requirements. what do customers ask for? What products does the competition offer?

What is the minimum viable product and what is the first need that must be satisfied.<br><br>

<h3>Improving products</h3>

However, if the products are already underway, things change. One of the big questions that product managers ask themselves is how to deal with the annual roadmap update.<br>

What do we do next? What do we improve or what do we incorporate? or what do we discontinue?<br><br>

 

The process is usually as follows:<br>

- Incidents reported by the support team are collected.<br>
- Improvements requested by customers are added.<br>
- The technical department also includes various technical projects because the infrastructure needs to be renewed.<br>
- The Commercial Department wants to create a new product that is requested a lot by customers.<br>
- The competition has pulled a feature and is also included as an item.
- Someone in the company has thought that this or that element can be redone, they have sent an email and they have told them that it will also be included in the list.<br><br>
 

With this, there is a list of hundreds of functionalities, which naturally the development department cannot carry out all of.<br>

If there is luck, the product department will get together, analyze the list, perhaps they will follow the RICE framework to analyze it: Scope, Impact, Safety and Effort.<br>

If there is no luck, the product manager and the development manager will get together and see what they think is important and/or urgent for this year. And they will be the ones that will be carried out.<br>
What is highly probable is that this planning is not at all in accordance with the company's strategy.<br>
<br>
<h3>Aligning the company strategy and the roadmap</h3>
There are different reasons why the roadmap is not aligned with the company's strategy:<br>

- There is no strategy.<br>
- It has not been communicated correctly.<br>
- The strategy does not agree with the market.<br>
- If there is no strategy, create one.<br><br>

Ask the questions:<br>

Where will the company be in 3 years?<br>
Is the situation in the current market one of growth, stagnation or decrease in share?<br>
Is there any expansion plan or is it worth attacking a new market?<br>
Are new products needed to increase sales?<br>
These strategic questions should already be resolved in the company's strategic plan. But if they are not, it is a good time to answer them.<br><br>

<h3>Strategic Product Plan</h3>

The first step is always market analysis. The vision of the clients, the competition and the opportunities that arise in the market must be the starting point of any strategy.<br>

The financial perspective would be the second step because a company is created to make money. And, therefore, it must not be forgotten that profits must be generated.<br>

At this point it will be where the board of directors must align the company's strategy to the points seen previously.<br>

With all this information, product managers will be able to establish next year's product strategies, as well as the positioning they want to give it.<br><br>
